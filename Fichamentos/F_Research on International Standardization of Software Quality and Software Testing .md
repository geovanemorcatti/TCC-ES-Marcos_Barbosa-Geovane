Ponciano, Lesandro; Brasileiro, Francisco; Simpson, Robert; Smith, Arfon. "*Volunteers' Engagement in Human Computation for Astronomy Projects*," in *Computing in Science & Engineering*, vol. 16, no. 6, pp. 52-59, Nov.-Dec. 2014. doi: [10.1109/MCSE.2014.4](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2014.4)

## 1. *Content* Summary

The article explores the *international standardization* of *software quality* and *software testing*, highlighting its importance for the software sector, which plays a *key role* in the global economy. *Software quality* is *crucial* for the healthy development of the software industry, and *software testing* plays a *vital role* in ensuring that quality. *Standardization* is seen as a technical means to regulate *software quality* and *software testing*, aiming to improve the quality of software products, reduce development and testing costs, and provide guidance and support for the development of the software industry. The article provides a detailed overview of *international standards* for *software quality* and *software testing*, analyzing their relationship and highlighting issues and suggestions related to these standards. This research is valuable for stakeholders such as demanders, developers, independent evaluation parties, and quality assurance and control personnel to understand and use the relevant standards of *software quality* and *testing*.

## 2. *Bibliographic* Summary 

* *ISO/IEC 25000 series of standards:* This series of standards addresses the requirements and assessment of *quality* of systems and software, known as "*SQuaRE*" or "*25000 series of standards*", providing models, measures, requirements, and evaluation processes applied to the assessment of *quality* of systems and software.
* *ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 software testing standards:* These standards are dedicated to defining an agreed set of standards for *software testing*, including testing processes, testing documentation, testing techniques, that can be used by any organization. The core of these standards is the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series, with other related standards such as work product reviews, process evaluation, testing tool capability, among others.
* *System and software quality standards:* Quality standards for systems and software are related to the requirements and assessment of *quality* of systems and software, providing models, measures, requirements, and evaluation processes applied to the assessment of *quality* of systems and software.

## 3. *Quotations* Summary 

* "*Quality is the life of software.*"
* "*Low-quality software may bring about different levels of consequences, ranging from affecting the user experience to causing serious accidents.*"
* "*Software testing and software quality complement each other and can be used as one of the means to improve software quality.*"
* "*The standardization of software quality and software testing is developing rapidly and has become the trend of software quality development.*"
* "*Properly applying system/software quality and testing standards would contribute to specify system/software quality requirements, evaluate software quality, improve the ability to manage and execute software testing, thereby improving the quality of system and software.*"
